For more detail, please refer to this URL[Win10 环境下搭建 Qt5.13.2 + OpenCV4.5.1 + MinGW 开发环境] (https://blog.csdn.net/justidle/article/details/121488711)。

# Step 2: Project 1, First Qt project using OpenCV to read a picture
Using QtCreator 4.10.1 to generate a "Qt Widgets Application", use the default selection, But in "Kit Selection", please use "MinGW 64-bit" not use "MSVC2017 64bit".
In this project, we will open a picture and show this picture in QMainWindow.
